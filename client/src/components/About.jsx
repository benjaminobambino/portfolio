      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>I am a full-stack software engineer taking my wide background of creativity, 
        versatility, coachability, relatability, hard work, ongoing learning, and critical 
        thinking into the depths of code. Coming from the worlds of music and philosophy, I 
        aim to make well-thought and beautiful contributions wherever I am.
      </p>
      <p>After several years 
        of thoroughly enjoying life as a touring musician, I found that my touring life was 
        not sustainable with the direction I wanted to go with my growing family. I discovered 
        a deep love for software engineering and can hardly believe I didn&rsquo;t discover it sooner.
